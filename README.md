# 📊 Minimal Expense Tracker – Bar Chart POC with Database Support

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/marufrobin/Minimal_Expense_Tracker)

A simple and minimal proof-of-concept (POC) to visualize expenses using bar charts in Flutter. Built using the [`fl_chart`](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart) package, this project showcases how to render a clean bar chart with a scalable data model—ideal for integrating into personal finance or analytics apps.

## 📊 Overview

This Flutter project demonstrates how to:

* Render a **bar chart** with custom X and Y axis values.
* Use a simple `BarChartDataModel`.
* Keep the UI responsive and theme-aware (light/dark mode).
* Build a clean UI as a foundation for future enhancements like BLoC-driven dynamic data or backend integration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone or Copy** this repo.

2. **Add the dependency** in `pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     fl_chart: ^0.64.0 # Check pub.dev for latest
   ```

3. **Import and Use** in your app:

   ```dart
   import 'screens/expanse_chart_screen.dart';

   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return Scaffold(
       appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Expense Chart")),
       body: ExpanseChartScreen(),
     );
   }
   ```

## 🔧 Features

* ✅ Clean integration of `fl_chart`
* ✅ Custom `BarChartDataModel`
* ✅ Minimal, theme-aware UI
* ✅ Stateless & reusable widget
* ✅ X-axis labels as **weekdays**

## 🧱 Project Structure

```
lib/
├── screens/
│   └── expanse_chart_screen.dart
```

---

## 🧪 How It Works

### 🎯 BarChartDataModel

```dart
class BarChartDataModel {
  final int? x;
  final double? y;

  BarChartDataModel({this.x, this.y});
}
```

### 📊 ExpanseChartScreen

* Initializes dummy list of `BarChartDataModel`
* Maps values into `BarChartGroupData`
* Renders with `fl_chart` inside a `SizedBox`

```dart
final List<BarChartDataModel> data = [
  BarChartDataModel(x: 0, y: 10),
  BarChartDataModel(x: 1, y: 20),
  ...
  BarChartDataModel(x: 6, y: 70),
];
```

---

## 🗂️ Widget Details

### 📁 `expanse_chart_screen.dart`

#### Key Implementations:

* **Dynamic Bar Builder**:

  ```dart
  List<BarChartGroupData> _barChartDataBuilder(List<BarChartDataModel> data)
  ```

* **Custom X-axis Label Formatter**:

  ```dart
  String daysName(int dayIndex)
  ```

* **Minimal Border Theme**:

  ```dart
  FlBorderData _borderDesign(ThemeData theme)
  ```

---

## 💡 Customization Tips

* Inject real-time or dynamic values using BLoC or Provider.
* Add animations using `barTouchData` and `BarTouchTooltipData`.
* Easily extend to monthly, yearly, or category-based expenses.
* Customize bar color based on value threshold.
* Add legends or custom tooltips.

---

## ✅ To Do

* [ ] Add axis titles (X/Y)
* [ ] Animate bar chart
* [ ] Make chart fully dynamic (BLoC/Provider)
* [ ] Add support for multiple datasets
* [ ] Improve accessibility and localization
